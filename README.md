# Content First
In this assignment, we created a website showcasing a websafe font in an attempt to make it look <i>Cool</i>. 

For a warm-up, we wrote haikus about coding or something in our chosen font and web safe colors and here is [mine](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jennlikespie123/Content-First/blob/master/haiku.html), written in the wonderful Times New Roman and yes I know it is extra


For the site, I gave our friend Times a nice home and [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jennlikespie123/font/blob/master/TIMESNEWROMANBABY.html) is the outcome.
