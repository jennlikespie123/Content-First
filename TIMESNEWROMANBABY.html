<section class="about" id="about"> <p>Our very best friend, the very backbone of all things formal and academic, who's always there for a shoulder to cry on while writing report papers, the one and only .｡*ﾟ+.*.｡<b>Times New Roman</b>ﾟ+..｡*ﾟ+, was created in 1929 by Stanley Morison and Victor Lardent. It was created for a newspaper, which is also where it gets its name; from the <i> Times </i> of London. Times New Roman is naturally narrower than many other fonts used in body text. Even the bold style of TNR is fairly narrow for bold. This allows newspapers to fit in more text per line, and save space. TNR is also known as one of the most <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/times-new-roman-is-the-most-trustworthy-font-study-finds-a7209116.html" target="_blank">trustworthy</a> fonts. The font is familiar and versatile, so it creates a comfortable feel for most people.</p>


<p>Because it was used in a daily newspaper, the new font quickly became pop­u­lar among print­ers of the day. In the decades since, type­set­ting devices have evolved, but Times New Roman has always been one of the first fonts avail­able for each new device (includ­ing per­sonal com­put­ers). This, in turn, has only increased its reach.</p></section>
