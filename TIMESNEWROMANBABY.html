<section class="about"> <p>Our very best friend, the very backbone of all things formal and academic, who's always been there for a shoulder to cry on while writing report papers, the one and only .｡*ﾟ+.*.｡<b>Times New Roman</b>ﾟ+..｡*ﾟ+, was created in 1929 by Stanley Morison and Victor Lardent. It was created for a newspaper, which is also where it gets its name; from the <i> Times </i> of London. Times New Roman is naturally narrower than many other fonts used in body text. Even the bold style of TNR is fairly narrow for bold. This allows newspapers to fit in more text per line, and save space. TNR is also known as one of the most <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/times-new-roman-is-the-most-trustworthy-font-study-finds-a7209116.html" target="_blank">trustworthy</a> fonts. The font is familiar and versatile, so it creates a comfortable feel for most people.</p>


<p>Because it was used in a daily newspaper, the new font quickly became popular among printers of the day. In the decades since, typesetting devices have evolved, but Times New Roman has always been one of the first fonts available for each new device (including personal computers). This, in turn, has only increased its reach.</p></section>

<section class="designers">Times New Roman was created in 1929 by Stanley Morison and Victor Lardent. In the early 1900s typography was progressing rapidly, but newspapers were failing to keep up with the advances. The Times of London used a chunky serif font that was hard on the eye and wasteful of ink and paper. When Morison criticised The Times for its typeface in 1929, the newspaper challenged him to come up with something better. In his writings, Morison says that he looked to old-style fonts for inspiration, and set upon modifying a 16th-century typeface called Plantin. A sketch sheet was handed to Victor Lardent, a staff illustrator for The Times, who finalized the design. The Morison-Lardent drawings were accepted, and on October 3 1932, The Times went to print with its proud new typeface.</section>
